"""Deterministic post-processing for audit-mode rows.

The LLM auditor proposes a granular 0-10 reproduction ``score`` (audit_schema.py);
this module enforces the non-negotiable anti-cheat rules in code so they do not
depend on the auditor's goodwill: (1) any HIGH-severity cheat flag caps the score
at 0, and (2) a partial/reproduced score (>=6) asserts a run actually computed the
metric, so if the auditor itself reports ``execution_verified=False`` that grade is
incoherent and is capped to the unverifiable ceiling -- an un-executed run can never
count as reproduced. It then derives the coarse ``verdict`` and the ``reproduced``
boolean from the (possibly capped) score, plus the run-health ``verification_status``
(degraded when the auditor output is malformed).
