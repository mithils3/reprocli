"""Audit-mode inputs: render the central claim and the agent run-directory manifest.

The auditor grades one agent reproduction attempt per paper. Its inputs are:
  - the paper's ``central_claim`` (from the audit pool), and
  - a manifest of the agent's run directory (its *.log files, output artifacts,
    and any code it wrote), which the auditor then explores with the
    path-confined run-dir tools (list_run_files / read_run_file / write_run_file
    / bash — the last two can write a re-scoring script into the run dir).
