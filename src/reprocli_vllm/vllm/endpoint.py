"""Resolve which served endpoint the runner should talk to.

This is the consumer side of the reprocli_serve seam. The agent core is
provider-agnostic: it only POSTs chat-completions to a base URL, so swapping the
model behind it is purely a URL change. A base URL can come from three places, in
priority order:

1. an explicit ``--vllm-server-url`` flag,
2. the ``REPROCLI_SERVER_URL`` environment variable,
3. an endpoint file named by ``REPROCLI_ENDPOINT_FILE`` (the JSON that
   reprocli_serve publishes; we read its ``base_url`` field).

If none is set, the resolver returns ``None``: there is no embedded server, so the
repro harness renders prompts as a dry run and the auditor runner exits with an
error pointing at ``reprocli_serve``.

Which model id to send in each request is resolved the same way: ask the server
what it serves (``GET /v1/models``) and use the single advertised model, unless an
explicit name is given via ``--served-model-name`` / ``REPROCLI_SERVED_MODEL``.
