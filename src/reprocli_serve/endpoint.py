"""The published endpoint contract.

A single small JSON file is the entire cross-repo seam. The server writes it once
it is healthy; a consumer (the reprocli runner, or anything else) reads ``base_url``
from it.

This module is the format's one definition: the writer and the reader sit together
here, and the consumer side imports ``read_base_url`` instead of re-parsing the
keys. The dependency only ever points this way — the serving half imports nothing
from the agent packages (see the package docstring).
