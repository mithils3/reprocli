"""Context compaction by tool-stdout elision — the tier that keeps the loop going.

When the conversation nears ``max_input_tokens`` we recover space by replacing the
*contents* of old, bulky tool results with a short ``[elided N chars — on disk at
…]`` placeholder, and by dropping the chain of thought from old assistant turns.
Every assistant turn keeps its ``content`` and ``tool_calls``, every small tool
result, and the pinned head (system + task prompt) are kept **verbatim**.

Why elision rather than a brain-call summary (the prior tier): most of a full
context is tool stdout — pip/download logs, GPU eval logs, file dumps. Eliding that
stdout leaves the agent's own words intact, so its stated intent (what it just
learned, what it planned to do next) survives the compaction boundary instead of
being flattened into a lossy third-person summary.

Old chain of thought goes too, and it has to: on a model whose template replays
prior-turn reasoning (DeepSeek-V4 forces this whenever tools are in the request)
the CoT is not a minor term. It measured 49-72% of the input ceiling in sweep
2883229 and killed 16 of 27 runs on ``context_budget`` — an un-elidable floor that
no amount of stdout elision could reach, because this tier used to keep assistant
turns whole. Dropping it costs the agent its verbatim recall of *how* it reached a
past conclusion while keeping *what* it concluded (``content``) and *what it did*
(``tool_calls``).

Nothing is lost to disk: both the elided stdout and the dropped CoT live in the
durable evidence store (``trajectory.jsonl`` + ``agent.full.log``), which the
placeholder points at, so an elided number can be re-read instead of re-computed
and the full reasoning trace survives for analysis.

Cut discipline (kept from the prior tier): keep ~``keep_recent_tokens`` of the
newest messages verbatim so fresh results — and the reasoning the agent is
actively working from — are never touched, and never compact behind the pinned
system + task head. We shrink ``role:"tool"`` contents in place and strip the
``reasoning`` key, but never drop or reorder a message, so no tool result is ever
stranded from the assistant ``tool_calls`` that produced it.

vLLM prefix-cache caveat: shrinking an old message invalidates the KV cache from
that message on. We fire rarely (only near the ceiling) and never touch the recent
tail, so the cache rebuilds a single time.
