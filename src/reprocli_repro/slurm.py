"""SLURM substrate — a held GPU allocation the agent runs successive steps into.

The agent's GPU access is **one allocation held for the episode**, not a fresh
``salloc`` per command. The first ``run_gpu`` call acquires it and every later call
runs into the same node, so the agent stops re-queueing between install → verify →
run:

    # acquire once (returns the instant the alloc is granted, then stays up):
    salloc --no-shell -A <account> -p <partition> --nodes=1 --gpus=<k> --time=<min>
    # run each step into the held jobid (no new queue wait), inside the sandbox image:
    srun --jobid=<jobid> --ntasks=1 apptainer exec --nv ... <sif> bash -lc 'cd <ws> && <cmd>'
    # release when the agent is done (or at teardown):
    scancel <jobid>

``<account>/<partition>`` come from the cluster profile (``cluster.py``);
``<k>``/``<min>`` come from the model's ``run_gpu`` arguments on the call that
*starts* the session. ``--time`` is the hold's hard lifetime (SLURM kills it at the
wall limit) and the budget pre-authorization. Queue wait is naturally excluded from
billing: ``acquire_session`` blocks during the wait and the meter only starts the
clock once the allocation is granted (see ``gpu_session``).

The ``srun`` payload (the Apptainer wrap + ``cd`` + ``<cmd>``) is built by
``env.exec_argv(..., on_gpu=True, sandbox=...)`` — ``on_gpu`` adds ``--nv`` so the GPU
step sees the device + CUDA driver; the CUDA toolkit itself comes from the image, not a
host ``module load``. ``build_acquire``/``build_srun`` are pure (the tests assert the
exact argv); the ``*_session`` helpers execute them. ``salloc --no-shell`` is the one
cluster-specific seam — some sites need a held ``salloc ... sleep`` or
``SallocDefaultCommand`` instead.
