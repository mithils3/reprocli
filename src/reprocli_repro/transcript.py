"""Conversation shaping and incremental output writing for the reproduce loop.

Split out of ``loop.py`` to keep the driver focused. These are forked analogs of
the shared final-message and output helpers, minus the auditor-specific
extracted/audit rows: repro writes the raw response JSONL (and an optional round
trace). The agent's terminal output is its ``report.json`` (Phase 5) — an account
of what it ran and measured; the *verdict* is the auditor's, not written here.
