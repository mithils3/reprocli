"""Post-episode workspace pruning: reclaim accidental large downloads.

The agent's ``workspace/`` (bound to ``/repro/workspace`` in the sandbox) is NVMe
scratch it clones code and builds a venv into. It is also where a mis-issued
``load_dataset`` / ``wget`` / ``git clone`` of a full dataset lands, and those can
be tens of GB. Nothing downstream needs them: the S6->S7 auditor grades
``report.json`` plus the durable ``evidence/`` trajectory, never the workspace
scratch, and the Supabase sink only uploads ``stats.json`` + ``agent.full.log``
from ``evidence/``. So once an episode reaches a terminal state we prune the
workspace's big artifacts to keep the run root (and the shared filesystem) small.

Three steps, all confined to ``workspace/`` (``reference/`` and ``evidence/`` are
never touched) and all skipping symlinks so we only ever delete a link, never the
thing it points at:

  1. delete the agent's Python venv(s) whole — the prompt tells it to build a
     ``.venv`` and install a multi-GB aarch64 CUDA torch into it; that install is
     the single biggest reclaimable artifact and must go as a unit (the size
     passes below would only shred it partially). Venvs are found by their
     definitive ``pyvenv.cfg`` marker, so a repo-nested or oddly-named one counts.
  2. delete any single regular file larger than the threshold, then
  3. delete the *tightest* subdirectory whose total still exceeds the threshold —
     the deepest qualifying dir, so a sharded dataset dir (many sub-threshold
     shards) is removed whole while the enclosing cloned code repo survives.

Deletion is best-effort and logged with a path + size line each; a filesystem
error on one entry is reported and skipped, never raised, so pruning can never
strand an otherwise-finalized run.
