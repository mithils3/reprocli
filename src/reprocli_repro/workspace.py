"""Per-paper workspace setup for one reproduction episode.

Integrates the run-directory layout resolved in ``inputs.resolve_run_paths`` (the
shared "directory maker": ``<runs-dir>/<arxiv_id>/<budget>h/<run_id>/`` with a
fresh time+random ``run_id`` so re-runs of the same paper never collide) and
materializes everything the agent needs *before* the loop starts:

  - the directory layout (``workspace/`` rw, ``reference/`` ro, ``evidence/``),
  - the read-only ``reference/`` copy (paper LaTeX + every supplement file),
  - the durable ``evidence/`` sinks.

It deliberately does **not** clone the paper's code, install its dependencies, or
build a venv: that is the agent's job. The agent builds its venv as its first
setup step, inside the Apptainer container (see ``prompts/prompt_reproduce.txt``),
and installs a GH200 (aarch64) CUDA ``torch`` into it from the PyTorch wheel index
— the raw CUDA image has no prebuilt torch to inherit.
