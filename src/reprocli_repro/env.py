"""Tool-enforced execution environment for the reproduction agent.

The agent issues plain shell commands; the **tools** (never the model) decide where
each one runs. ``exec_argv`` is the single seam both sides use: the orchestrator tools
(``workspace_bash``, the venv build) pass it straight to ``subprocess.run``; the GPU
substrate (``slurm.py``) splices it in after ``srun``.

Every step body is just ``cd <ws> && <cmd>`` — the agent's cwd pinned to the episode's
workspace. There is no host ``module load`` and no CPU/GPU split in the body any more:
the CUDA toolkit and ``nvcc`` come from the **Apptainer image** the step runs inside
(``sandbox.py``), not from the bare host; ``torch`` is not prebuilt — the agent installs
an aarch64 CUDA build into its venv (see the prompt). ``on_gpu`` no longer
changes the body; it only tells the sandbox to add ``--nv`` so a GPU step sees the
device, while a CPU-setup step on the login node does not.

The sandbox is **mandatory** for every agent step (``sandbox`` is passed on each call);
the pure builders keep it optional so argv-shape tests can assert the bare body without
the container wrap.
