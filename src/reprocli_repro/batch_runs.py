"""Resolve one sbatch sweep's runs to the exact bundles a grader should read.

A sweep is a ``batch_id`` (``slurm-<jobid>``) shared by every ``reprocli_repro``
process the sbatch launched; each run leaves its bundle at
``<runs-dir>/<arxiv_id>/<budget>h/<run_id>/``. Naming a paper is therefore not
enough to name a run: a paper attempted more than once has several bundles, and
"the sweep's attempt" is only identifiable through the ``run_id`` its row carries.

This module reads the sweep's rows from the run-viewer Supabase and resolves each
``run_id`` to the bundle it actually wrote, so a grader points at one attempt and
its verdict patches the matching ``repro_runs`` row. Read-only; needs
``SUPABASE_URL`` + ``SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY``.
