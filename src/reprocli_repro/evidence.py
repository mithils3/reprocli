"""Durable evidence store for one reproduction episode.

The auditor (S7) trusts only what it can re-trace from disk, so every reproduction
episode writes a durable record under ``evidence/`` as it works:

  - ``commands.log``    -- one human-readable line per shell command (cmd, rc, cwd),
  - ``trajectory.jsonl``-- one JSON row per tool call / step (machine-readable),
  - ``env.lock``        -- the resolved environment (``uv pip freeze``),
  - ``patches/``        -- every diff the agent applied, saved verbatim.

These are *primitives*: ``init_evidence`` lays the files down at setup; the tools
(``workspace_bash``, ``apply_patch``) and the loop append to them as the episode
runs. Microcompact can safely elide stale tool output from the conversation
precisely because the ground truth lives here, not in the model's context.
