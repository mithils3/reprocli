"""Per-run telemetry sidecar: a metrics beacon inside each held GPU allocation.

``gpu_session.ensure_session`` calls ``start`` the moment an allocation is
granted; ``release``/``drop_lost`` call ``stop``. The beacon is one detached
``srun --overlap`` step into the held jobid running
``python -m reprocli_repro.metrics_beacon --role run``, so the run's JIT GPU
node shows up in the viewer's host panel while the agent works. Same opt-in as
``supabase_sink`` (``event_sink.credentials_from_env``) and the same discipline:
every entry point swallows everything — telemetry may never break a run or a test.

The live ``srun`` client Popens live in a module registry keyed by jobid
(rather than on ``GpuSession``) so ``context.py`` stays plumbing-free. ``stop``
only terminates the *local* srun client — the ``scancel`` on release kills the
remote step itself; we just must not leave the client lingering.
