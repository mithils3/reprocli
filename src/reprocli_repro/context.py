"""Per-episode execution state for the reproduction agent.

``ExecutionContext`` is the repro analog of the auditor's ``Paper``: one
instance per paper/episode, keyed by ``custom_id`` (the arXiv id) in the tool
loop. Where the auditor threads ``execute_tool_call(call, paper=paper)``, the
repro loop threads ``execute_repro_tool_call(call, ctx)`` so every tool acts on
*this* episode's mutable workspace, budget meter, allocation, and evidence dir.

Phase 0 ships the dataclass plus the minimal ``Budget`` surface the loop's
compute-budget guardrail needs (``remaining`` / ``exhausted`` / ``consume``).
Later phases populate the fields: ``workspace`` + ``evidence`` (Phase 2),
``budget`` metering with the hw-multiplier table and ``allocation`` (Phase 3).

    The first ``run_gpu`` call acquires one allocation (``salloc --no-shell``) that

    the agent stops paying a fresh queue wait between install → verify → run. It is
    released when the agent is done (``run_gpu`` with ``release=true``) or at episode
    teardown.

    Because the node is held across the agent's reasoning/install gaps too — not
    only while a command runs — the meter bills **wall clock**: ``gpus x (held
    seconds) x hw``, charged incrementally (``gpu_session.charge_accrued``) so the
    budget ceiling still fires mid-hold. ``last_charged`` advances on every charge so
    the running total equals the real held wall, never double-counting.
