"""Held-GPU-session lifecycle: acquire once, reuse, bill wall clock, release.

``run_gpu`` no longer allocates+releases a GPU per command. The first call ACQUIRES
one SLURM allocation that stays up; every later call runs into it with no re-queue;
and the agent RELEASES it when done. Because the node is held across the agent's
reasoning/install gaps too, the meter bills **wall clock** — ``gpus x (held seconds)
x hw`` — charged incrementally so the budget ceiling still fires mid-hold.

The seam is small and shared:

* ``ensure_session`` — acquire if none is held (queue wait excluded: the clock starts
  only once the allocation is granted);
* ``charge_accrued`` — bill the wall held since the last charge and advance the
  marker (so the running total equals real held wall, never double-counted). Called
  by ``run_gpu`` after each step *and* by the loop guardrail between rounds, so a
  long reasoning gap on a held node still depletes the budget;
* ``release`` — bill the final sliver, ``scancel``, clear the session, record it;
* ``teardown_all`` — release any session still held at loop end (crash/interrupt
  safety net over the per-episode release).

``tools/run_gpu.py`` is the thin tool wrapper over this; ``slurm.py`` is the raw
salloc/srun/scancel substrate underneath.
