"""Shared urllib PostgREST/Storage transport for the Supabase writers.

``supabase_sink``, ``audit_sink``, and ``audit_upload`` each hand-rolled the same
urllib request (headers with ``apikey``/``Authorization``/``Prefer``, JSON or raw
body, error handling). This is the one place that plumbing lives now; the callers
keep their own retry/timeout choices via parameters, so behaviour is unchanged:

* the two live sinks fire-and-forget — they only look at the status code and count
  a failure, so they wrap :func:`request` and treat ``code == 0`` (transport error,
  no HTTP response) or ``code >= 300`` as a failed POST;
* ``audit_upload`` needs the response body, so it uses the ``(code, text)`` return
  directly (an HTTP 4xx/5xx returns its PostgREST error body; a DNS/connection
  error returns ``(0, str(err))``).

Every caller has always been single-attempt; ``max_attempts`` is exposed so a
caller can opt into transient-error retries without changing the default.
