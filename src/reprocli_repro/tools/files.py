"""Path-confined write tools for the reproduction agent.

The agent *reads* files through ``workspace_bash`` (``grep -n`` / ``sed -n`` /
``cat`` -- targeted, line-numbered, and far cheaper than dumping whole files into
context), so this module ships only the mutating ops: ``write_file`` and
``edit_file``.

Adapted from ``run_dir_tools._resolve_within``: every path the agent writes must
resolve inside one of the episode's writable roots -- ``workspace`` (the editable
clone) and ``evidence``; the ``reference/`` copy is never writable. These are a
subset of the roots the Apptainer sandbox (``sandbox.py``) binds read-write — the file
tools stay tight to durable source/evidence, while bulk ``/tmp`` scratch is
shell-driven, not a file-tool path — so the tool-layer check is a strict inner
boundary nested inside the OS sandbox.

The agent works against the short in-container paths the sandbox remaps the episode
dirs onto (``/repro/workspace`` etc.); since these tools do real *host* I/O,
``_to_host`` first translates a leading ``/repro`` back to the host run dir. Relative
paths then resolve against the workspace (the same cwd ``workspace_bash`` runs in), and
host-absolute paths must still fall within an allowed root. ``..`` segments and NUL
bytes are rejected outright, and ``resolve()`` canonicalizes symlinks before the
containment check, so traversal, symlink escapes, and writes outside the bundle are
all rejected before any I/O happens.

``edit_file`` replaces the old diff-application tool (a ported Codex
context-matching patch engine): across sweeps it errored on 68% of its 66
calls -- agents pass repo-relative paths from inside the cloned repo, hunks
mis-locate, and models learned to route around it via whole-file ``write_file``
rewrites instead. ``edit_file`` trades diff hunks for one exact-string
replacement: no context matching to fuzz, and when the path itself is wrong (the
paper's repo cloned into ``workspace/<repo>/...`` but the model addresses it by a
bare repo-relative path) it suffix-searches the workspace tree for an unambiguous
match instead of failing outright. Ambiguity and no-match failures still get a
recovery hint (the suffix-search + mismatch-hint helpers below), same spirit as the
old engine's context-miss diagnostics.
