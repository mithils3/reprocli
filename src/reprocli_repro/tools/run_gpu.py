"""The GPU step — the reproduction agent's interactive GPU shell.

Everything else the agent does (clone, venv, installs, edits, inspecting data) is
cheap CPU work in ``workspace_bash``; ``run_gpu`` is the one tool that provisions a
GPU. The first call ACQUIRES one ``salloc`` allocation that **stays held**; every
later call runs into the same node (``slurm.run_in_session``) with no new queue
wait, so the agent installs torch, verifies CUDA, and runs the experiment as
successive ``run_gpu`` calls on one allocation instead of re-queueing each time.
The agent frees it with ``release=true`` the moment it is done; ``gpu_session``
also releases it at episode teardown.

Every step's output is *streamed* to ``evidence/gpu_step_<n>.log`` as it arrives
(``slurm.run_in_session`` tees it), so a step killed at the --time wall or our
timeout still leaves everything it printed on disk — and this tool returns the
tail instead of nothing. Blind re-runs of killed jobs were the single biggest
compute sink in the 06-29 batch.

The tool is the budget meter's enforcement point. The held node is billed by
**wall clock** — ``gpus x (held seconds) x hw`` — because the GPU is reserved across
the agent's reasoning/install gaps, not only while a command runs:

* **before acquiring** -- ``budget.affordable`` refuses to start a session whose
  worst case (``gpus x minutes x hw``, the ``--time`` pre-authorization) would
  overspend the remaining H100-hour budget;
* **before reusing** -- a launch onto a held session with under
  ``STALE_LAUNCH_SECONDS`` of --time left rotates the session out (release +
  re-acquire) so the command lands on a fresh full-length hold instead of a doomed
  one — never a dead-end refusal that leaves the spent session bound;
* **after each step / on release** -- ``gpu_session.charge_accrued`` bills the wall
  held since the last charge (the loop guardrail charges it between rounds too, so a
  long reasoning gap on a held node still depletes the budget);
* **either way** -- one structured row lands in ``evidence/trajectory.jsonl`` and the
  command in ``evidence/commands.log`` so the auditor can re-trace what ran and cost.

When the charge drives the budget to zero the loop's guardrail releases the session
and force-finals the episode on the next round (``loop.apply_guardrails``).
